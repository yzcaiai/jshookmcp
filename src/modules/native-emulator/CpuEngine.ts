/**
 * CpuEngine — self-built, dependency-free ARM64 interpreter (A-plan / M0).
 *
 * Replaces the earlier vendored unicorn.js (GPL-2.0, incompatible with this
 * project's AGPL-3.0 license) with a from-scratch decoder. An ISA is not
 * copyrightable, so a clean-room implementation carries no license burden and
 * gives us full control over memory, registers, and instrumentation hooks that
 * later milestones (ELF loader, libc/syscall/JNI layers) build upon.
 *
 * Strategy is target-driven and incremental: we decode the instruction classes
 * real target `.so` functions actually use, and throw on anything unimplemented
 * with the raw opcode so the gap is obvious and testable. Registers are stored
 * as 64-bit BigInt (true fidelity — no unicorn.js i64-via-number precision loss).
 *
 * Decode is structured as a top-level dispatch on the AArch64 main encoding
 * group (bits[28:25]) into four families — DP-immediate, branch/system,
 * load/store, DP-register — each a focused method. This keeps the hot fetch loop
 * branching on a single discriminant first (V8-friendly) and the instruction
 * set extensible without growing one linear if-chain.
 *
 * L1 adds `loadElf`: parse an ELF64 AArch64 shared object and map its PT_LOAD
 * segments at their virtual addresses, ready to execute from the ELF entry.

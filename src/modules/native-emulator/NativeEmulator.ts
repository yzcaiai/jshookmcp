/**
 * NativeEmulator — one-stop facade over the L0–L4 stack (CpuEngine + ElfLoader +
 * bionic stubs + Android syscalls + JniEnvironment).
 *
 * Wires the layers a real Android `.so` needs into a single object so a caller
 * (or an MCP tool handler) can load a shared object, register a mock "Java
 * world", and invoke an exported symbol or a `Java_*` JNI entry point — without
 * hand-assembling the JNIEnv plumbing each time. It composes the existing public
 * APIs only; the CPU/JNI internals are untouched, so it adds capability without
 * putting the green L0–L4 tests at risk.
 *
 * ── Flutter APK input contract (extractor lives in ./apk.ts) ──
 * A Flutter app ships as an APK (a zip). Its native payload is under lib/<abi>/:
 *   - libapp.so     → Dart AOT machine code. NOT a normal callable `.so`: its
 *                     .text is VM/isolate snapshots that need a Dart runtime
 *                     (THR/PP/null regs, tagged pointers, ObjectPool dispatch),
 *                     which this JNI-oriented facade does not model. Route it to
 *                     the Dart layer, not here.
 *   - libflutter.so → the engine (C++/Skia/DartVM); rarely the reversing target.
 *   - third-party / hardening `.so` and MethodChannel-lowered native algorithms
 *     → standard ARM64 + JNI, which is exactly what this facade emulates.
 * The CPU is AArch64, so only lib/arm64-v8a/*.so is loadable. Other ABIs and Dart
 * AOT code are rejected by the extractor/classifier rather than silently run.

   * methods throws a clear error so leaking a disposed emulator into a new
   * session fails loudly rather than silently corrupting state.
   *
   * **Design rationale & references:**
   *
   * Memory leaks in emulators are a well-documented hazard. Unicorn Engine
   * issue #1595 demonstrates that incomplete initialization paths can leave
   * allocated memory unreleased. QEMU's 2026 TCG cleanup improvements focus on
   * consistent resource teardown across all termination paths. This dispose
   * pattern follows the resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII) principle
   * adapted for managed runtimes: explicit cleanup when the GC cannot infer
   * ownership (mapped memory is hidden in Uint8Array buffers, JNI handles are
   * opaque integers).

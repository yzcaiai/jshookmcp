| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apk_packer_detect` | Detect Android APK packers by matching `lib/&lt;abi&gt;/lib*.so` filenames against user-supplied customSignatures (ReDoS-guarded regex compilation). The framework ships no built-in signature table — callers provide their own. **Does not unpack, execute, or otherwise interact with the packed payload.** |
| `apk_packer_list_signatures` | List the in-process signature table used by `apk_packer_detect`. Empty by default; reflects caller-managed state at request time. Optionally filter by case-insensitive category substring. |

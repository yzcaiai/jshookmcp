# Reference Overview

The following tool domains are available:

## Recommended reading order

1. Start with `browser / network / workflow` to understand the day-to-day path.
2. Continue with `debugger / hooks / streaming` for runtime analysis.
3. Finish with `core / sourcemap / transform / wasm / process / platform` for deeper reverse-engineering coverage.
